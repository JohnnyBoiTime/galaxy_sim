# galaxy_sim

To do:

create rest of planets
make planets have their own rotation
create a background that is like the milky way galaxy

Then:

Make orbits mathematically accurate
Make planets rotations be mathematically accurate
Make the time it takes for the plaents to rotate around the sun mathematically accurate

Fun to do's:
Use real-time API data to make the solar system more accurate,
maybe have each planet recieve real time data form NASA or some planet
API so each planet's position, rotation, etc. is accurate.
Maybe do this instead of what is under "then". 

Simulator?
Maybe make it an actual simulator, where gravity can be simulated and you can crash planets into each other
